## 🐚 Shell Scripts for Automating Some of the Boring Tasks 😴🥱

Also a chance for me to learn a bit of shell scripting while we're at it! 🚀

### 🔧 `init_mlproject.sh`

A simple shell script to quickly set up a basic machine learning project. It does the following:

- Creates a new project folder
- Initializes a Git repo
- Sets up a Python virtual environment
- Installs PyTorch with CUDA support
- Adds a `.gitignore`
- Creates a `main.py` with a one-liner to check CUDA availability
